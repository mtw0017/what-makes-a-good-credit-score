# what-makes-a-good-credit-score
This project investigates the factors that influence credit risk, using a labeled dataset from a real-world financial application context. The goal is to predict whether an applicant is likely to be a bad credit risk (1) or a good credit risk (0) based on a variety of personal, financial, and professional features.
